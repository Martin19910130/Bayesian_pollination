# Bayesian_pollination
# column names:
# species = Plant species (should be only one, either dianthus carthusianorum or scabiosa ochroleuca)

# climate = The climate treatment (ambient or future)

# plot_id = The plot where the samples where taken from (10 different plots)

# treatment = pollination treatment (either control or supplement)

# individual = The unique individual from each plot, e.g. C1 should be given 10x (one for each plot, if we have a C1 on each plot)). (8 unique values: C1, C2, C3, C4, 
#              S1 , S2, S3, S4

# individual_id = combination of plot and individual (e.g. 1_1_C1)
# season = the season the sample was taken (fall or summer)
# status = the status of the capsule/seed head (not important)
# Seeds_capsule = the seed per capsule (Note for scabiosa it is named seeds_flowerhead)
